# Snake Game

This game was made following the 100 days of code python bootcamp created by Dr. Angela Yu

# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics module. The game allows the player to control a snake, navigate it around the screen, and collect food to grow in length. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features

- Snake movement: The player can control the snake's movement using the arrow keys.
- Food generation: The game randomly generates food for the snake to collect.
- Score tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score and displays it on the screen.
- High score: The game saves the highest score achieved in a file and displays it alongside the current score.
- Collision detection: The game detects collisions between the snake and the food, walls, or its own body.
- Game over: If the snake collides with a wall or its own body, the game ends and the score is reset.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
3. Run the `snake_game.py` file using the Python interpreter:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Play

1. Run the game by following the installation instructions.
2. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to navigate the snake on the screen.
3. The snake will move continuously in the direction indicated by the arrow keys.
4. Collect the food (displayed as a red circle) by moving the snake's head to its position.
5. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer, and the score increases.
6. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body, as this will end the game.
7. Try to achieve the highest score possible and beat your previous high score!
